# envapi
> An API to interact with environment files

Since [v20.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.6.0) Node.js has built-in support for dotenv files. [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) does the same years before. [envfile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envfile) even before that. So, why another one? The answer is simple: to provide a more flexible and powerful API.
